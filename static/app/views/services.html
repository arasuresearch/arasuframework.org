    Web designers have struggled in two areas since the advent of the internet: website conversions and evolving
    consumers. Most designers struggle creating websites that convert visitors in an acceptable range without looking
    both mechanical and boring. This issue is often more challenging than one might expect because the solution often
    requires a scientific approach. Unfortunately most designers don’t like science, which means conversion strategies
    are often ignored on the websites they create. Their choice to ignore these elements can have dire consequences for
    their clients and can lead to disappointing performance and sometimes even business failure.

    The second problem is really just an extension of the first as it deals directly with website design and conversion
    rates. Most web designers struggle keeping up with consumers. Consumer behavior is changing faster than ever in
    human history. They no longer likes sales pitches, limited selection, or being told when they can or can’t shop.
    Their entire lives have become “on-demand” and most are a lot busier than they used to be. This means that today’s
    websites need to address the objections of today’s consumer in addition to looking good. Because today’s consumer is
    often short on time, they prefer simple websites. They want ease of use. They want to be informed, but hate reading
    (How about that for making sense?). Today’s consumer doesn’t read, they browse. They like engaging elements that
    convey messages quickly and concisely.

    These changes have caused us to rethink the way we build websites. Fortunately, we spend gobs of money and time
    learning the latest technology and understanding how the consumer is changing. This constant learning process has
    lead our firm to evolve into areas we never thought possible. This evolution has led to innovations, process
    changes, and the creation of proprietary software exclusive to our company.
